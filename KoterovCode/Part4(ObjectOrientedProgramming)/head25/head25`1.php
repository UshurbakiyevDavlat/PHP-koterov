    //Namespace
        //Okay, to prevent conflict between names from different libraries in one programm we need namespace.
            //Namespace - fragment of the programm which has it`s name ,functions , consts, and other named things.
                //example in head25namespace.php (appendix: namespace PHP and php can not be created, it is booked namespaces)
                //example of using namespace in head25use_namespace.php
            //We also can use several namespaces in one file (but it is very unrecommended)
                //However example in head25few.php

            //Hierarchy of namespaces 
                //example in head25absolute.php

            //Importing help to us cut names from differend namespaces
                //example in head25use.php  
            
            //Autoloading of classes
                // help us automize loading of useful classes for current script
                // with __autoload()

            //spl_autoload_register()
                //Nowadays uses instead __autoload() because of density in realization
                //for example head25spl_autoload_registerUse.php  and head25anonim.php
